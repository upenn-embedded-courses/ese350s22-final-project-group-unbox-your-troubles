How to compile/run our code:

A total of three boards (2 NodeMCUs and 1 Arduino) are needed to run this code.
- The file titled NodeMCU_AccelerometerReadings.ino needs to be flashed to the NodeMCU connected to the accelerometer inside the punching bag using the Arduino IDE.
- The file titled NodeMCU_Communication.ino needs to be flashed to the NodeMCU connected to the Arduino over I2C using the Arduino IDE.
